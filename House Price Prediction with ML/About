House price prediction using machine learning involves building models that can estimate the value of a property based on various features. This is a common and impactful project for beginners in machine learning and data science, as it introduces fundamental concepts of regression.
Key steps involved in a house price prediction project:
Data Collection and Understanding:
Obtain a dataset containing house features (e.g., location, size, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, amenities, age) and their corresponding sale prices. Datasets from platforms like Kaggle (e.g., "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques") are frequently used.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, data types, and potential issues like missing values or outliers.

Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values: Impute or remove data points with missing information.
Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing ones (e.g., combining features, extracting information from categorical variables).
Categorical Encoding: Convert categorical features (like location or property type) into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure they have a similar scale, which can improve model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize relationships between features and the target variable (house price) using plots like scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.
Identify trends, patterns, and potential correlations.

Model Selection and Training:
Choose appropriate regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines like XGBoost or LightGBM).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Train the selected model(s) on the training data.

Model Evaluation:
Assess the model's performance using relevant evaluation metrics for regression, such as:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R2) score

Deployment (Optional):
Save the trained model for future use.
Develop a simple application (e.g., a web application) to allow users to input house features and get a predicted price.

Common libraries used:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms, preprocessing tools, and model evaluation metrics.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
